# Datafy templates

These are the template used by datafy to create new projects.

They are split into two categories:

- projects: these are templates used to create new projects with Datafy
- resources: these templates can be used to add resources to existing project in Datafy

## Projects

The project templates contain templates that can help you get bootstrapped with using Datafy. At the moment we have
some basic projects that setup spark, pyspark and a python project integrated with Datafy and the best practices we
believe in.

## Resources

Resources provide templates on how to give IAM access for the jobs you are running on Datafy. For now we focused on the
two operators we are supporting.

## Development

If you want to contribute you should have a look at [the development documentation](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
