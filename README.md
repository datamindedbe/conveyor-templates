# Conveyor templates

These are the template used by [Conveyor](https://conveyordata.com/) to create new projects. 
If you are interested in Conveyor, you can visit our [website](https://conveyordata.com/).

The templates are split into two categories:

- projects: these are templates used to create new projects with Conveyor
- resources: these templates can be used to add resources to existing project in Conveyor

## Projects

The project templates contain templates that can help you get bootstrapped with using Conveyor. At the moment we have
some basic projects that setup spark, pyspark and a python project integrated with Conveyor and the best practices we
believe in.

## Resources

Resources provide templates on how to give IAM access for the jobs you are running on Conveyor. For now we focused on the
two operators we are supporting.

## Packages

The packages templates help you to get started with using packages on Conveyor.
The template contains sample code to send alerts from Airflow.

## Development

If you want to contribute you should have a look at [the development documentation](./DEVELOPMENT.md).
